#Problem Statement
# Welcome to Antallagma - a digital exchange for trading goods. Antallagma started its operations 
#5 years back and has 
# supported more than a million transactions till date. 
#The Antallagma platform enables working of a traditional exchange on 
# an online portal. 
# 
# On one hand, buyers make a bid at the value they are willing to buy ("bid value‚Äù) 
#and the quantity they are willing to buy. 
#                                                                      
#Sellers on the other hand, ask for an ask price and the quantity they 
#are willing to sell. The portal matches the buyers 
#                                                                      
#and sellers in realtime to create trades. All trades are settled at the end 
#of the day at the median price of all agreed trades. 
#                                                                      
# You are one of the traders on the exchange and can supply all the material being 
#traded on the exchange. In order to 
# improve your logistics, you want to predict the median trade prices and volumes for 
#all the trades happening (at item 
# level) on the exchange. You can then plan to then use these predictions to create an 
#optimized inventory strategy. 
#                                                                      
# You are expected to create trade forecasts for all items being traded on Antallagma along 
#with the trade prices for a 
# period of 6 months. 
# Evaluation Criteria: 
# Overall Error = Lambda1 x RMSE error of volumes + Lambda2 x RMSE error of prices 
# Where Lambda1 and Lambda2 are normalising parameters 

# Data
# Data Dictionary:
# Variable	Definition
# ID	      Unique_transaction_ID
# Item_ID	  Unique ID of the product
# Datetime	Date of Sale
# Price	    Median Price at Sale on that day(Target Variable_1)
# Number_Of_Sales	Total Item Sold on that day(Target Variable_2)
# Category_1	Unordered Masked feature
# Category_2	Ordered Masked feature
